# Project 3: Hospital and Healthcare System Location and Financial Information Analysis :bar_chart: :hospital:

## Summary
In this project, we aim to provide insightful location and financial information analysis through interactive databases and data visualizations, utilizing a combination of **Python and JavaScript libraries**. 

We evaluate the revenue mix of hospitals in California, **analyzing data from both the largest and smallest hospitals based on the size of their balance sheets or gross assets**. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and insights that can inform the user about the current healthcare system operations in California.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to **leverage interactive data visualization tools and libraries** to evaluate the revenue mix of California-based hospitals and healthcare systems' location and financial information. By integrating technologies and methods not previously covered in class, we aim to **expand our technical repertoire and provide users with interactive and insightful experiences**.

**We aim to answer these three basic questions found in the data:**
1. Where are the *Top 10/Bottom 10 hospitals and healthcare systems located*?

2. What is the mix of *pay type*? 

3. What is the breakdown of *type of care*?

## Key Objectives
- To *create interactive data visualizations* using a mix of Python and JavaScript libraries.
- To *utilize one database technology* for data storage and extraction.
- To include user-driven interactions for *a dynamic visualization experience*.
- To ensure our visualizations are powered by a *dataset containing at least 100 records*.
- To *showcase three different views in our final visualization* to provide comprehensive insights.
- *Key Findings*.
